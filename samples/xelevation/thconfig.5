#! The only think that is missing is connection line between stations 1
#! in these two branches.

#! Therion does not automatically generates these lines, because their
#! shape usually depends on the map situation. 
#! 
#! To draw such line, all you need to do is to create a simple scrap 
#! with this line. Here is example:
source
#!CODE
scrap sc -proj extended
  point 0 0 station -name 1 -from 5 -visibility off
  point 100 0 station -name 1 -from 2 -visibility off
  line map-connection
      0   5
      0  15
    100  15
    100   5
  endline
endscrap
#!ENDCODE
#! As you can see, even there are two stations with same name, they
#! are distinguished by <code>-from</code> option, which specifies
#! previous station in extended elevation. With this scrap, you receive
#! final map:
map mc
  sc
endmap
endsource

select mc
select m
