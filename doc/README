Therion has NO documentation yet, we include only some hints for hackers

Perl, TeX, MetaPost, GhostView (all programs are part of standard Linux 
distribution) and Survex should be installed

Add /therion/bin to your path

edit data file (use two example files for beginning; no documentation of data
format is available (hack the source code;-))

copy file /thrion/etc/Config to your data directory and change it
according your demands

run script `th' with name of data file as argument

you should see result as file(s) *.eps
