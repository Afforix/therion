This is Therion, cave surveying software. 

It allows the drawing of cave surveys on the computer. Data can be added to 
a drawn plan and it will be realigned to fit any new closures or fixed points. 
All the work is done by the Therion program. The front-end for entering data 
is XTherion. It uses Survex for centreline dataprocessing.

It is the sort of software where you need to read the manual in order to use 
it effectively. You are unlikely to get a PDF out of it without doing that.
